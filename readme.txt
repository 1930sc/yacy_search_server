Startup of YACY:

- on Linux        : start startYACY.sh
- on Windows      : double-click startYACY.bat
- on Mac OS X     : double-click startYACY.command (alias possible!)
- on any other OS : set your classpath to the 'classes' folder
                    and execute yacy.class, while your current system
		    path must target the release directory to access the
                    configuration files.

Then start to administrate yacy by using the applications on-line
interface: browse to http://localhost:8080, you see you personal
proxy configuration and administration interface.

Configure you internet connection to use yacy at port 8080.
You can also change the default proxy port.

If you like to use yacy not as proxy but only as distributed
crawling/search engine, you can do so.
Start crawling at the 'Index Creation' menu point.
