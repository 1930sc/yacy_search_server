Please visit www.yacy.net for latest changes or new documentation.
YaCy comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY!
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; see file gpl.txt for details.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a P2P-based Web Search Engine
and also a http/https proxy.

The complete documentation can be found inside the 'doc' subdirectory
in this release. Start browsing the manual by opening the index.html
file with your web browser.

YOU NEED JAVA 1.4.2 OR LATER TO RUN THIS APPLICATION!
PLEASE DOWNLOAD JAVA FROM http://java.sun.com

Startup of YaCy:

- on Linux        : start startYACY.sh
- on Windows      : double-click startYACY.bat
- on Mac OS X     : double-click startYACY.command (alias possible!)
- on any other OS : set your classpath to the 'classes' folder
                    and execute yacy.class, while your current system
                    path must target the release directory to access the
                    configuration files.

Then start using YaCy with the applications on-line interface:
browse to http://localhost:8080 where you can see your personal
search, configuration and administration interface.

If you want to use the proxy, simply configure your internet connection
to use YaCy at port 8080. You can also change the default proxy port.

If you like to use YaCy not as proxy but only as distributed
crawling/search engine, you can do so.
Start crawling at the 'Index Creation' menu point.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact the author:
Send an email to Michael Christen (mc@anomic.de) with a meaningful subject
including the word 'yacy' to prevent that your email gets stuck
in my anti-spam filter.

If you like to have a customized version for special needs,
feel free to ask the author for a business proposal to customize YaCy
according to your needs. We also provide integration solutions if the
software is about to be integrated into your enterprise application.
