# Configuration file for YaCy Snap packaging with Snapcraft (see https://snapcraft.io/)
name: yacy-search
version: '1.921'
summary: YaCy peer-to-peer search engine and intranet search appliance
description: |
  YaCy is a decentralized search engine software.
  Its search results come from a network of independent peers, 
  where no single entity decides what gets listed, or in which order results appear.
  YaCy nodes can also be placed in intranet environment 
  which makes YaCy a replacement for commercial enterprise search solutions.

    # desktop - to launch the default desktop navigator when starting (with xdg-open command) - not strictly necessary
