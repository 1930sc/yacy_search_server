<h3>Ranking</h3>
<p>
	One of the most cited reasons for YaCy is the freely configurable ranking system. The ranking settings have a major impact on
	the  displayed search results, so it is worthwhile looking at them. For example searching for current news you might 
	want to give pages with a more recent date a higher rank, whereas searching for a rare documentation other ranking factors are
	more helpful. As YaCy knows over 30 ranking factors, YaCy-UI will offer for the ease of use ranking pre-sets (most relevant, most popular,
	most recent) to choose from. Currently you can set the <a href="http://localhost:8080/Ranking_p.html">default ranking</a> 
	via the existing user interface.
