<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
	YaCy-UI is going to be a rich client for YaCy attempting to provide a new, more functional and easier search interface.
	Unlike the current server based interface YaCy-UI makes heavy use of jQuery, JavaScript, Ajax, XML and XSLT. This
	approach offers some neat advantages, one example could be the integration of sciencenet via opensearch. The overall
	idea is to integrate functionallity on a modular basis (e.g. a webshot function could be integrated by linking to
	another, even local web service without the need to further extend YaCy's functionallity). Currently YaCy-UI is at most
	alpha status, so I would be very greatful for feedback and bug reports!
