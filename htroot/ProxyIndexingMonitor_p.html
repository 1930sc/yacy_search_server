<h2>Index Monitor for Proxy Indexing</h2>
<p>
This is the control page for web pages that your peer has indexed during the current application run-time
as result of proxy fetch/prefetch.
<b>No personal or protected page is indexed</b>;
those pages are detected by properties in the HTTP header (like Cookie-Use, or HTTP Authorization)
or by POST-Parameters (either in URL or as HTTP protocol)
and automatically excluded from indexing.
</p>

<p><form action="ProxyIndexingMonitor_p.html" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<div class=small><b>Proxy pre-fetch setting:</b>
this is an automated html page loading procedure that takes actual proxy-requested
URLs as crawling start points for crawling.</div>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr valign="top" class="TableCellDark">
    <td class=small>Prefetch Depth:</td>
    <td class=small><input name="proxyPrefetchDepth" type="text" size="2" maxlength="2" value="#[proxyPrefetchDepth]#"></td>
    <td class=small>
        A prefetch of 0 means no prefetch; a prefetch of 1 means to prefetch all
        embedded URLs, but since embedded image links are loaded by the browser
        this means that only embedded href-anchors are prefetched additionally.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top" class="TableCellDark">
    <td class=small>Store to Cache:</td>
    <td class=small><input type="checkbox" name="proxyStoreHTCache" align="top" #(proxyStoreHTCacheChecked)#::checked#(/proxyStoreHTCacheChecked)#></td>
    <td class=small>It is almost always recommended to set this on. The only exception is that you have another caching proxy running as secondary proxy and YaCy is configured to used that proxy in proxy-proxy - mode.</td>
  </tr>
