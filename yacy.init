# peer-to-peer construction for distributed search

#      -> this is the superseed file
# 2nd: the files that can be retrieved by the superseeds' URLs
#      are called seed list-files.
#      -> the seed list-files contain IP/port combinations of running
#         AnomicHTTPProxies
# 3rd: the peers that are targeted within the seed files are called superpeers
# 4th: the superpeers hold and share a list of all client/search/crawl peers
#
# some superpeers should be able to create again seed list-files.
# These superpeers must upload their IP or their list of peer-IP's to a
# ftp location to create the seed list-file.
# Everyone who do so should mail his/her new seed location to mc<at>anomic.de
# The seed list-file location will then be included in the superseed file.
# This superseed file is available then at two localtions:
# - it is included in every distribution and
