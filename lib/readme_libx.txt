libx ADD-ON for YaCy (C) by Michael Peter Christen; mc@anomic.de
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains some libraries that YaCy needs for certain
functions, like parsing of PDF documents.
YaCy works without these libraries and is distributed without them;
however, if you want to use these extra functions or you are a YaCy
developer, simply place the libx directory along the 'lib' directory
in the YaCy application path.
