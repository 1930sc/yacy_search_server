#
# 1) Create a new certificate:

#    *) For testing purposes, you can create a keystore with a self-signed certificate, 
#       using the following command:
#       C:\> keytool -keystore mySrvKeystore -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias mycert

# 2) Import an existing certificate:
# 
#    Alternatively you can import an existing certificate in pkcs12 format into
#    the keystore.
#    
#    This can be done by setting the pkcs12XXX properties accordingly, e.g.
#    pkcs12ImportFile = c:/temp/keystore.pkcs12
