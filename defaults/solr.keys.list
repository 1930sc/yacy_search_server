## this is a list of all solr keys
## solr can be used as alternative index target, solr is NOT the primary indexing system of YaCy
## this complete list of keys can be reduced:
## reduced list of keys can be placed in DATA/SETTINGS/solr.keys.<profile>.list
## where they can be used as profiles for solr index transport

## the syntax of this file:
## - all lines beginning with '##' are comments
## - all non-empty lines not beginning with '#' are keyword lines
## - all lines beginning with '#' and where the second character is not '#' are commented-out keyword lines
