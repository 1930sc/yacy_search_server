<h2>Volunteers</h2>

<p>YACY's architecture with the PLASMA search engine and
the P2P-based distributed index was developed and implemented by Michael Peter Christen.

<p>However, this project is just at the beginning and needs contributions from other developers, since there are many ideas how this project can move on to a broad range of users.

<p>There are also some long-term targets. If the index-sharing someday works fine, maybe the browser producer like Opera or Konqueror would like to use the p2p-se to index the browser's cache and therefore provide each user with an open-source, free search engine.

<p>At this time, some contributions already have been made. These are:
<ul>
<li><b>Alexander Schier</b> did much alpha-testing, gave valuable feed-back on my ideas and suggested his own. He suggested and implemented large parts of the popular blacklist feature. He supplied the 'Log'-menu function, the skin-feature, many minor changes, bug fixes and the Windows-Installer - version of yacy. Alex also provides and maintaines the <a href="http://www.suma-lab.de/yacy/">german documentation</a> for yacy.</li>
<li><b>Natali Christen</b> contributed the YACY logo and the design of the Kaskelix mascot.</li>
<li><b>Wolfgang Sander-Beuermann</b>, executive board member of the German search-engine association <a href="http://www.suma-ev.de/">SuMa-eV</a>
and manager of the meta-search-engine <a href="http://www.metager.de">metaGer</a> provided <a href="http://www.suma-lab.de/yacy/">web-space for the german documentation</a> and computing resources for a <a href="http://www.suma-lab.de:8080">demo peer</a>. He also pushed the project by arranging promotional events.</li>
<li><b>Timo Leise</b> suggested and implemented an extension to the blacklist feature: part-of-domain matching.</li>
<li><b>Martin Schwarze</b> wrote a <a href="http://suma-ev.de/downloads/yacy-haz.pdf">artikel/press release "Jedermanns Suchmaschine" about the YACY Projekt</a>; published in the <a href="http://www.haz.de">Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung</a>.</li>
<li><b>Matthias Kempka</b> provided a linux-init start/stop - script</li>
<li><b>Martin Thelian</b> made system-wide performance enhancement by introducing thread pools. He also provided a plug-in system for external text parser and integrated a pdf and word document parser library.</li>
<li><b>Roland Ramthun</b> owns and administrates the <a href="http://www.yacy-forum.de/">German YaCy-Forum</a>. He also cares for correct spelling in the YaCy interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>Further volunteers are very welcome.
Please <a href="Contact.html">contact</a> me if you have something that you are willing to do for this project. In any case: before you start something to do, please ask me in advance if I would like to integrate it later. Thank You!</p>
